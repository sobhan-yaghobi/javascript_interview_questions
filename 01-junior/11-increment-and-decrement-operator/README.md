## Increment & Decrement

The increment (++) and decrement (--) operators are used in JavaScript to increase or decrease the value of a variable by 1.

```js
let score = 20
const finalScore = --score

console.log(finalScore) // Result => 19
```

but in this code

```js
let score = 14
const result = score--

console.log(result) // Result => 14
```

- Tips : In this case the operator is placed after the variable and the return value of the expression is the value of the variable before the increase/decrease
